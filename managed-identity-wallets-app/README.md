## Overview

The Managed Identity Wallets Application is a Spring Boot project encompassing services, controllers, events, health
checks, and additional functionalities. It also incorporates features related to Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI).

### Invoker Components

The system comprises four distinct component types, each activated under specific conditions to potentially alter the
application's state:

- API
- Event Listener
- Cron Jobs
- Health Indicator

### Business Components

These components have the ability to invoke factories, generating essential objects to execute their designated tasks.
Utilizing these objects, they can access required services to fulfill their functions.

### Persistence Components

Services initiate interactions with repositories to persist newly created or updated application states.
