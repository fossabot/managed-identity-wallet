/**
 * In the context of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), a "DID Fragment" refers to a portion of the DID that comes
 * after a '#' character. The DID Fragment is often used to reference a specific resource or document
 * associated with the DID.
 * <p>
 * For example, a DID might look like this: did:example:12345678
 * <p>
 * In this case, the DID is did:example:12345678, and the DID Fragment would be any part of the DID that appears after
 * a '#' character, if present. For example:
 * <p>
 * did:example:12345678#section-1
 * <p>
 * Such a did fragment is represented using this class by calling 'new DidFragment("section-1")'.
